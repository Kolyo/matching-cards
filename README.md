# Matching cards

The game is a task for a job interview. It should have been created for around 3h and after the review will be with
added functionality.

### The assignment itself:

We would like you to implement a Memory game. The game involves a set of cards with pairs of images. The cards are
placed face-down, and players take turns flipping them over to find matching pairs. Your implementation should not use
any other frameworks or non-utility libraries than React, and should take no more than 3 hours to complete.

You have the freedom to design the game as you see fit, but please consider readability and code structure. You can
focus on any aspect of the game, such as choosing images, adding points or timing, designing for different devices, or
making it cheat-proof.

If you need any assistance to what you can implement, here are some examples:

- Static or dynamic cards?
- Does a player get points? Is there timing involved? A scoreboard?
- Accessibility? Controlled by keyboard?
- Responsive design that works for mobile and desktop?
- Security and cheat-proof?
- Sounds?
-

Please document your game and explain any decisions or assumptions you make. Note the things you would have liked to do
if you had more time. If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask us.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this task. We appreciate your effort and look forward to seeing your
implementation.

### Some notes:

- As stated earlier, the time spent for this piece of code was around 3.5 hrs excluding setup, finding images API and
  creating the repository.
- There were several corners cut here and there, where it could be done more beautifully.
- Lots of functionality is missing - variable deck size; time, on top of the moves; a scoreboard; more beautiful UI and
  many more.
